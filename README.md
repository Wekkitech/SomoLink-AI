# 🌍 SomoLink  
### AI-Powered Digital Learning Infrastructure

---

**SomoLink** is an **AI-native, solar-driven connectivity and education platform** built by [Wekkitech Limited](https://wekkitech.net) to deliver reliable, safe, and intelligent internet access to schools and communities across emerging regions.

It fuses **artificial intelligence, renewable energy, and open data** to create an adaptive network that learns from each connected site — optimizing bandwidth, caching educational content, ensuring child-safe browsing, and sustaining itself through community participation.

## 🧭 Vision

> To reimagine school connectivity as an **intelligent, inclusive public good** — turning digital access into measurable learning equity.

SomoLink provides **free internet for schools** and **affordable access for surrounding communities**, sustained through transparent, community-driven micropayments.  
It operates entirely on solar power, runs AI models locally for efficiency, and publishes anonymized performance data to support open, accountable education infrastructure.

## ⚙️ System Overview

SomoLink’s architecture is built around four intelligent layers:

| Layer | Description | Key Technologies |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Edge Layer** | Solar-powered hardware at schools providing Wi-Fi, caching, and telemetry. | Go / Rust / Linux / TFLite / ONNX / MQTT |
| **AI & Data Layer** | Predictive models for solar energy, bandwidth optimization, anomaly detection, and learning analytics. | Python / PyTorch / LightGBM / MLflow / Airflow |
| **Backend Services** | APIs, billing, data ingestion, and federated learning orchestration. | FastAPI / NestJS / PostgreSQL / Kafka / gRPC |
| **Frontend & Dashboards** | School, community, and ops dashboards with real-time insights. | React / Next.js / Tailwind / Recharts / TypeScript |

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

- **AI-Powered QoS & Forecasting**  
  Machine learning models predict solar yield and dynamically allocate bandwidth to prioritize education traffic during school hours.

- **Edge Caching for Curriculum Access**  
  Locally caches educational content (Kiwix, Kolibri, OpenStax, etc.) to ensure continuity during outages or low bandwidth.

- **Child-Safe Browsing & Deep Search**  
  DNS and AI content filtering for pupils; open, deeper search for community users with safety boundaries.

- **Learning Analytics & Recommendations**  
  AI analyzes usage data to calculate *Connected Learning Hours (CLH)* and recommends improvements to teachers and administrators.

- **Sustainability Through Community Participation**  
  Schools connect free via unique codes; community access fees automatically fund school internet uptime and maintenance.

- **Open APIs & Transparency**  
  Public APIs expose uptime, learning hours, and sustainability metrics — promoting accountability and replication.
